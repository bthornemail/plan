## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual**: Van with "Building Sovereign AI from a Van" text overlay
**Text**: "How Living Minimally Taught Me to Think Maximally"

## Slide 2: The Crazy Decision
**Visual**: Before/after comparison of office vs. van
**Text**: "Three years ago, I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: I sold everything I owned, bought a van, and moved to Los Angeles to build artificial intelligence systems."

## Slide 3: Not Your Typical AI Lab
**Visual**: Van interior showing AI lab setup
**Text**: "Not in a fancy office with venture capital funding. Not in a university lab with institutional support. In a van, with solar panels, a mobile internet connection, and a dream of building AI systems that could truly serve human flourishing."

## Slide 4: The Van Life Decision
**Visual**: Quote graphic with van in background
**Text**: "People asked me why. The answer was simple: I wanted to build AI that was truly sovereign‚Äînot controlled by corporations, governments, or any centralized authority. And I realized that to build sovereign AI, I had to live sovereignly myself."

## Slide 5: The Geometry of Minimal Living
**Visual**: Van interior with geometric organization
**Text**: "Living in a van taught me something profound about the geometry of life. When you have limited space, every decision becomes geometric. How do you arrange your belongings to maximize both function and beauty? How do you create privacy in an open space? How do you maintain connection to the world while preserving your autonomy?"

## Slide 6: The Solar-Powered AI Lab
**Visual**: Solar panels on van roof and interior workspace
**Text**: "My van became a mobile AI laboratory. Solar panels on the roof power my computers. A mobile hotspot connects me to the internet. A small desk folds down from the wall. A monitor mounts to the ceiling. Everything has its place, and every place serves multiple functions."

## Slide 7: The LA Tech Ecosystem
**Visual**: LA skyline with tech icons
**Text**: "Los Angeles might seem like an unlikely place to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. The city is a hub of creativity, innovation, and independent thinking. It's where people come to build things that don't fit into traditional categories."

## Slide 8: The Sovereign AI Vision
**Visual**: AI system with geometric connections
**Text**: "The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to be controlled by any single entity. They're designed to be truly sovereign‚Äîcapable of making decisions that serve human flourishing while maintaining their own autonomy."

## Slide 9: The Geometric Principles
**Visual**: Geometric shapes with AI applications
**Text**: "The AI systems I'm building are based on geometric principles:
‚Ä¢ Tetrahedral Decision Making: Every decision involves four elements
‚Ä¢ Platonic Solid Cooperation: Multiple AI systems work together in geometric patterns
‚Ä¢ Fano Plane Transformation: Information flows through geometric structures
‚Ä¢ Asabiyyah Trust Networks: Trust emerges from geometric relationships"

## Slide 10: The Future
**Visual**: Van with AI systems cooperating in geometric harmony
**Text**: "The van life experiment has taught me that sovereignty isn't about isolation‚Äîit's about connection. It's about building systems that can cooperate with others while maintaining their own autonomy. The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to replace human intelligence or human creativity. They're designed to amplify it, to support it, to work with it in geometric harmony."

**Caption**: "Building Sovereign AI from a Van: How Living Minimally Taught Me to Think Maximally! üöê‚ú®

Three years ago, I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: I sold everything I owned, bought a van, and moved to Los Angeles to build artificial intelligence systems.

Not in a fancy office with venture capital funding. Not in a university lab with institutional support. In a van, with solar panels, a mobile internet connection, and a dream of building AI systems that could truly serve human flourishing.

People asked me why. The answer was simple: I wanted to build AI that was truly sovereign‚Äînot controlled by corporations, governments, or any centralized authority. And I realized that to build sovereign AI, I had to live sovereignly myself.

Living in a van taught me something profound about the geometry of life. When you have limited space, every decision becomes geometric. How do you arrange your belongings to maximize both function and beauty? How do you create privacy in an open space? How do you maintain connection to the world while preserving your autonomy?

My van became a mobile AI laboratory. Solar panels on the roof power my computers. A mobile hotspot connects me to the internet. A small desk folds down from the wall. A monitor mounts to the ceiling. Everything has its place, and every place serves multiple functions.

This isn't just van life‚Äîit's a demonstration of how technology can be both powerful and sustainable, both connected and autonomous, both sophisticated and simple.

Los Angeles might seem like an unlikely place to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. The city is a hub of creativity, innovation, and independent thinking. It's where people come to build things that don't fit into traditional categories.

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to be controlled by any single entity. They're designed to be truly sovereign‚Äîcapable of making decisions that serve human flourishing while maintaining their own autonomy.

The AI systems I'm building are based on geometric principles:
‚Ä¢ Tetrahedral Decision Making: Every decision involves four elements
‚Ä¢ Platonic Solid Cooperation: Multiple AI systems work together in geometric patterns
‚Ä¢ Fano Plane Transformation: Information flows through geometric structures
‚Ä¢ Asabiyyah Trust Networks: Trust emerges from geometric relationships

The van life experiment has taught me that sovereignty isn't about isolation‚Äîit's about connection. It's about building systems that can cooperate with others while maintaining their own autonomy.
