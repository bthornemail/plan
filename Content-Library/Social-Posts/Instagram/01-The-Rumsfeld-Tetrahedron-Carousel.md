## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual**: Tetrahedron with "The Rumsfeld Tetrahedron" text overlay
**Text**: "The Hidden Geometry of Human Knowledge"

## Slide 2: The Famous Quote
**Visual**: Quote graphic with Rumsfeld's face
**Text**: "There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know." - Donald Rumsfeld

## Slide 3: The Four Faces
**Visual**: Tetrahedron with four faces labeled
**Text**: "What Rumsfeld didn't realize is that he was describing a perfect geometric structureâ€”a tetrahedronâ€”that reveals the fundamental architecture of human knowledge."

## Slide 4: Known Knowns (KK)
**Visual**: Face 1 of tetrahedron with checkmark icon
**Text**: "Face 1: Known Knowns (KK)
Things we know we know
â€¢ Facts, data, verified information
â€¢ 'I know that Paris is the capital of France'"

## Slide 5: Known Unknowns (KU)
**Visual**: Face 2 of tetrahedron with question mark icon
**Text**: "Face 2: Known Unknowns (KU)
Things we know we don't know
â€¢ Questions, research gaps, acknowledged limitations
â€¢ 'I know I don't know how quantum computers work'"

## Slide 6: Unknown Knowns (UK)
**Visual**: Face 3 of tetrahedron with lightbulb icon
**Text**: "Face 3: Unknown Knowns (UK)
Things we don't know we know
â€¢ Intuition, implicit knowledge, unconscious expertise
â€¢ 'I don't know I know how to read people's emotions'"

## Slide 7: Unknown Unknowns (UU)
**Visual**: Face 4 of tetrahedron with mystery icon
**Text**: "Face 4: Unknown Unknowns (UU)
Things we don't know we don't know
â€¢ Blind spots, hidden assumptions, unexplored territories
â€¢ 'I don't know I don't know about the existence of dark matter'"

## Slide 8: The Geometric Insight
**Visual**: Tetrahedron showing connections between faces
**Text**: "The tetrahedron isn't just a convenient way to organize knowledge types. It's the mathematical structure that emerges when you try to represent complete knowledge states in three-dimensional space."

## Slide 9: Why This Matters for AI
**Visual**: Comparison of AI vs. human knowledge processing
**Text**: "Traditional AI systems only work with Known Knownsâ€”they process data that's explicitly provided. But human intelligence operates across all four faces of the knowledge tetrahedron."

## Slide 10: The Future of AI
**Visual**: AI system with tetrahedral knowledge structure
**Text**: "The next generation of AI systems will be built on the knowledge tetrahedron model. Instead of just processing data, they'll recognize when they don't know something, develop intuitive capabilities, and explore unknown territories."

Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's famous quote about 'known knowns' and 'unknown unknowns' actually describes a perfect geometric structureâ€”a tetrahedronâ€”that shows how human intelligence really works.

Each face of the tetrahedron represents a different type of knowledge:
â€¢ Known Knowns (KK) - what we know we know
â€¢ Known Unknowns (KU) - what we know we don't know  
â€¢ Unknown Knowns (UK) - what we don't know we know
â€¢ Unknown Unknowns (UU) - what we don't know we don't know

The most profound insight? You can't have complete knowledge without all four types. Each face connects to the other three, creating a stable, self-supporting structure.

This isn't just philosophyâ€”it's the mathematical foundation for building AI systems that can truly understand and cooperate with humans. The future of AI isn't about making machines smarter, it's about making them more aware of the complete geometry of knowledge.

What are the unknown unknowns in your field? How do you think the knowledge tetrahedron could help you make better decisions? ðŸ¤”
