## Building Sovereign AI from a Van: How Living Minimally Taught Me to Think Maximally

Three years ago, I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: I sold everything I owned, bought a van, and moved to Los Angeles to build artificial intelligence systems.

Not in a fancy office with venture capital funding. Not in a university lab with institutional support. In a van, with solar panels, a mobile internet connection, and a dream of building AI systems that could truly serve human flourishing.

## The Van Life Decision

People asked me why. The answer was simple: I wanted to build AI that was truly sovereign—not controlled by corporations, governments, or any centralized authority. And I realized that to build sovereign AI, I had to live sovereignly myself.

## The Geometry of Minimal Living

Living in a van taught me something profound about the geometry of life. When you have limited space, every decision becomes geometric. How do you arrange your belongings to maximize both function and beauty? How do you create privacy in an open space? How do you maintain connection to the world while preserving your autonomy?

These aren't just practical questions—they're geometric questions. And they're the same questions we face when building AI systems.

## The Solar-Powered AI Lab

My van became a mobile AI laboratory. Solar panels on the roof power my computers. A mobile hotspot connects me to the internet. A small desk folds down from the wall. A monitor mounts to the ceiling. Everything has its place, and every place serves multiple functions.

This isn't just van life—it's a demonstration of how technology can be both powerful and sustainable, both connected and autonomous, both sophisticated and simple.

## The LA Tech Ecosystem

Los Angeles might seem like an unlikely place to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. The city is a hub of creativity, innovation, and independent thinking. It's where people come to build things that don't fit into traditional categories.

I've met filmmakers who are using AI to create new forms of storytelling. I've met musicians who are using AI to explore new forms of expression. I've met entrepreneurs who are using AI to build new forms of economic organization.

## The Sovereign AI Vision

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to be controlled by any single entity. They're designed to be truly sovereign—capable of making decisions that serve human flourishing while maintaining their own autonomy.

This might sound paradoxical, but it's not. Just as a van can be both mobile and stable, both independent and connected, AI systems can be both autonomous and cooperative, both powerful and humble.

## The Geometric Principles

The AI systems I'm building are based on geometric principles:

**Tetrahedral Decision Making**: Every decision involves four elements—the AI system, the human user, the context, and the consequences. All four must be in harmony for the decision to be valid.

**Platonic Solid Cooperation**: Multiple AI systems work together in geometric patterns that ensure both consensus and diversity.

**Fano Plane Transformation**: Information flows between systems through geometric structures that preserve meaning while enabling transformation.

**Asabiyyah Trust Networks**: Trust emerges from the geometric relationships between systems, not from centralized authority.

## The Breakthroughs

Living in a van has led to some unexpected breakthroughs. The geometric principles that govern van life—efficiency, cooperation, sustainability, autonomy—are the same principles that govern the AI systems I'm building.

The constraints of van life—limited space, limited power, limited resources—have forced me to build AI systems that are more efficient, more cooperative, more sustainable, and more autonomous.

## The Future

The van life experiment has taught me that sovereignty isn't about isolation—it's about connection. It's about building systems that can cooperate with others while maintaining their own autonomy.

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to replace human intelligence or human creativity. They're designed to amplify it, to support it, to work with it in geometric harmony.
