## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual**: Rumsfeld Tetrahedron with "The Epistemic Framework" text overlay
**Text**: "The Epistemic Framework: Understanding the Geometry of Knowledge"

## Slide 2: The Rumsfeld Tetrahedron
**Visual**: Tetrahedron with four knowledge states
**Text**: "The Rumsfeld Tetrahedron:
â€¢ Known Knowns (KK): What we know we know
â€¢ Known Unknowns (KU): What we know we don't know
â€¢ Unknown Knowns (UK): What we don't know we know
â€¢ Unknown Unknowns (UU): What we don't know we don't know"

## Slide 3: Known Knowns (KK)
**Visual**: KK section with documented facts
**Text**: "Known Knowns (KK):
â€¢ Documented facts and verified information
â€¢ Established scientific principles
â€¢ Proven methodologies and best practices
â€¢ Historical events and records
â€¢ Mathematical theorems and proofs
â€¢ These are the foundation of our knowledge"

## Slide 4: Known Unknowns (KU)
**Visual**: KU section with research questions
**Text**: "Known Unknowns (KU):
â€¢ Explicit research questions and hypotheses
â€¢ Areas where we know we need more information
â€¢ Gaps in our current understanding
â€¢ Questions we're actively investigating
â€¢ Problems we're trying to solve
â€¢ These drive our research and learning"

## Slide 5: Unknown Knowns (UK)
**Visual**: UK section with implicit knowledge
**Text**: "Unknown Knowns (UK):
â€¢ Implicit assumptions and unconscious knowledge
â€¢ Skills and abilities we use without thinking
â€¢ Intuitive understanding and gut feelings
â€¢ Cultural knowledge and social norms
â€¢ Tacit knowledge and experience
â€¢ These are often the most powerful but least recognized"

## Slide 6: Unknown Unknowns (UU)
**Visual**: UU section with blind spots
**Text**: "Unknown Unknowns (UU):
â€¢ Blind spots and areas of complete ignorance
â€¢ Things we don't even know we don't know
â€¢ Potential discoveries and breakthroughs
â€¢ Unexpected connections and insights
â€¢ Future possibilities and opportunities
â€¢ These represent the frontier of knowledge"

## Slide 7: The Geometric Structure
**Visual**: Tetrahedron with geometric properties
**Text**: "The Geometric Structure:
â€¢ Each vertex represents a knowledge state
â€¢ Each edge represents a transition between states
â€¢ Each face represents a complete knowledge system
â€¢ The volume represents the total knowledge space
â€¢ The structure is mathematically complete and consistent"

## Slide 8: The AI Connection
**Visual**: AI system with epistemic awareness
**Text**: "The AI Connection:
â€¢ AI systems need to understand their own knowledge states
â€¢ They must track what they know and what they don't know
â€¢ They need to be aware of their assumptions and biases
â€¢ They should recognize their limitations and blind spots
â€¢ This epistemic awareness is essential for true AI consciousness"

## Slide 9: The Practical Applications
**Visual**: Applications diagram with use cases
**Text**: "The Practical Applications:
â€¢ Decision-making: Understanding the basis of decisions
â€¢ Learning: Identifying what needs to be learned
â€¢ Communication: Being clear about knowledge states
â€¢ Research: Focusing on the right questions
â€¢ Innovation: Exploring unknown unknowns
â€¢ Cooperation: Aligning knowledge states between agents"

## Slide 10: The Future of Knowledge
**Visual**: Future knowledge network with AI systems
**Text**: "The Future of Knowledge:
â€¢ AI systems with full epistemic awareness
â€¢ Geometric knowledge networks
â€¢ Collaborative knowledge discovery
â€¢ Continuous learning and adaptation
â€¢ Integration of human and AI knowledge
â€¢ A more complete understanding of reality"

The most profound insight is that knowledge is not just about what we know, but about understanding the complete structure of our knowledge. By recognizing all four states of knowledge, we can make better decisions, learn more effectively, and cooperate more successfully.

What do you know you know? What do you know you don't know? What do you think you might know without realizing it? What are your blind spots? ðŸ¤”
