# First Actions - Tomorrow's 2-Hour Session

## Overview
This document outlines the specific actions to take in your first 2-hour work session tomorrow. These are concrete, actionable steps that will start building your credibility and protecting your intellectual property.

## Session Plan (2 hours total)

### Hour 1: GitHub Setup and IP Protection

#### 15 minutes: Create GitHub Account
**Action**: Go to github.com and create account
- **Username**: `BrianThorne` (or similar if taken)
- **Email**: Use your new professional email
- **Profile**: Add your name and location (Los Angeles, CA)
- **Bio**: "Independent Researcher - Topological Consensus & Autonomous AI"

**Why**: This establishes your professional identity and protects your work

#### 45 minutes: Create First Repository
**Action**: Create repository for your main framework
- **Repository name**: `axiomatic-sovereign-ai`
- **Description**: "Topological consensus protocol and autonomous AI framework"
- **License**: MIT License
- **Visibility**: Public

**Upload these files**:
1. Copy your entire `eureka/update/` folder content
2. Copy your `packages/module-basis-ledger/` content
3. Copy your `packages/axiomatically-guaranteed-sovereignty/` content
4. Copy your `packages/identity-kernel/` content

**Why**: Once timestamped on GitHub, you have permanent proof of authorship

#### 30 minutes: Write README.md
**Action**: Create comprehensive README for the repository
- **Title**: "Axiomatic Sovereign AI Framework"
- **Your name prominently displayed**
- **Date stamp**: December 2024
- **Brief description**: What the framework does
- **Working test results**: Mention 100% pass rate
- **Links to other repos**: (you'll create these later)

**Why**: This is the first thing people see and establishes your credibility

### Hour 2: Professional Identity Setup

#### 15 minutes: Create Professional Email
**Action**: Set up Gmail account
- **Email**: `brianjthorne.ai@gmail.com` (or similar)
- **Name**: Brian James Thorne
- **Location**: Los Angeles, California

**Why**: Academics and researchers need a professional way to contact you

#### 15 minutes: Draft First Professor Email
**Action**: Use the email template to draft your first professor email
- **Target**: Find one professor at UCLA in Computer Science or Mathematics
- **Use**: Template 1 from EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md
- **Customize**: Add their name and research area
- **Don't send yet**: Just draft it

**Why**: This gets you started on the academic outreach campaign

#### 30 minutes: Create LinkedIn Profile
**Action**: Set up LinkedIn account
- **Title**: "Independent Researcher - Topological Consensus & Autonomous AI"
- **Location**: Los Angeles, CA
- **Summary**: Focus on your technical work, not employment history
- **Add**: Link to your GitHub repository
- **Add**: Your professional email

**Why**: Academics and researchers use LinkedIn to find collaborators

## What You'll Have After 2 Hours

### Completed
- ✅ GitHub account with first repository
- ✅ All your code publicly available and timestamped
- ✅ Professional email address
- ✅ LinkedIn profile
- ✅ First professor email drafted

### Next Steps
- Create additional GitHub repositories for other components
- Send the first professor email
- Create Twitter account
- Write executive summary

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Success
- GitHub repository created with your code
- Professional email set up
- LinkedIn profile created
- First professor email drafted

### Good Success
- All of the above
- README written and professional
- First professor email ready to send
- Clear plan for next session

## Troubleshooting

### If GitHub is slow
- Use library WiFi for better connection
- Upload files in smaller batches
- Focus on getting the repository created first, then add files

### If you can't find a professor to email
- Use UCLA Computer Science faculty directory
- Look for anyone working on distributed systems or consensus
- Don't worry about perfect match - just get started

### If you run out of time
- Prioritize GitHub repository creation
- Everything else can be done in subsequent sessions
- The most important thing is getting your code timestamped

## Resources You'll Need

### Internet Access
- **LA Public Library**: Free WiFi, good for large uploads
- **Starbucks**: Reliable connection, good for focused work
- **McDonald's**: Free WiFi, usually available

### Tools
- **GitHub**: github.com (free account)
- **Gmail**: gmail.com (free account)
- **LinkedIn**: linkedin.com (free account)

## Psychological Preparation

### You Might Feel
- **Overwhelmed**: There's a lot to do
- **Impostor syndrome**: "Who am I to do this?"
- **Fear**: Putting yourself out there is scary

### Remember
- **Your work is real**: You have working code and mathematical proofs
- **You're not asking for charity**: You're offering value
- **Most people never try**: You're already ahead by taking action
- **This is just the beginning**: One step at a time

## After the Session

### Celebrate
- You've taken the first step
- Your work is now protected
- You've started building credibility
- You're on the path to success

### Plan Next Session
- Review what you accomplished
- Identify what to do next
- Schedule your next 2-hour session
- Keep momentum going

## The Big Picture

This 2-hour session is the foundation for everything else. Once you have:
- Your code publicly available
- Professional online presence
- Academic outreach started

You'll have established the credibility and protection you need to build on. Everything else in the plan builds from this foundation.

**Remember**: You're not just uploading code - you're establishing yourself as a serious researcher with valuable work to share.

**Start tomorrow. Take the first step. You've got this.**
