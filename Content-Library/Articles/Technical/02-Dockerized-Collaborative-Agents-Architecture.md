## 🐳 **Architecture Overview**

I'm excited to announce another major breakthrough in our geometric AI research: the successful implementation of **Dockerized Collaborative Agents** with integrated **Rumsfeld Analysis Framework**. This achievement represents a significant advancement in distributed AI intelligence and epistemic awareness.

The system currently runs **3 collaborative agent containers** that work together to provide distributed collaborative intelligence, each with specialized capabilities and integrated epistemic state tracking through the Rumsfeld tetrahedron framework.

## 🧠 **Rumsfeld Analysis Integration**

### **Epistemic State Framework**

The system implements the **Rumsfeld Tetrahedron** for complete knowledge space tracking:

```
        Unknown Unknowns (UU)
               /|\
              / | \
         Known    Unknown
        Unknowns  Knowns
         (KU)      (UK)
               \|/
        Known Knowns (KK)
```

#### **Four Knowledge States:**

1. **Known Knowns (KK)**: Documented, verified facts
   - Explicitly stated and documented
   - Consensus understanding
   - Measurable/verifiable

2. **Known Unknowns (KU)**: Tracked uncertainties and research agenda
   - Explicitly identified gaps
   - Research questions
   - Investigation targets

3. **Unknown Knowns (UK)**: Implicit assumptions and tacit knowledge
   - Unconscious assumptions
   - Cultural presuppositions
   - Hidden biases

4. **Unknown Unknowns (UU)**: Measured epistemic horizon
   - Awareness of limits
   - Blind spots in knowledge
   - Unforeseen risks

### **Integration with H²GNN System**

The dockerized agents integrate with the H²GNN system through:

#### **1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**
- **5 MCP Servers** provide standardized communication
- **Enhanced H²GNN MCP Server** for AI persistence
- **Knowledge Graph MCP Server** for semantic analysis
- **Geometric Tools MCP Server** for mathematical operations
- **LSP-AST MCP Server** for code understanding

#### **2. Persistent AI Identity Management**
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents maintain identity across sessions
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic knowledge organization using hyperbolic geometry
- **Context Preservation**: Seamless context transfer between development sessions
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of concept mastery

#### **3. Universal Signal Processing**
- **5-Cell Geometric DSP**: Universal framework for all signal types
- **FFT Universality**: Frequency-domain analysis across all signal domains
- **Geometric Constraints**: Betti numbers prevent feedback loops universally
- **Cross-Domain Translation**: Seamless signal transformation between domains

  "from": "agent_id",
  "to": "agent_id",
  "type": "message_type",
  "content": "message_content",
  "epistemic_state": {
    "known_knowns": [],
    "known_unknowns": [],
    "unknown_knowns": [],
    "unknown_unknowns": []
  },
  "geometric_metadata": {
