**Caption**: "The 5-Cell Topology: Universal Signal Processing for All Signal Types! üì°‚ú®

The 5-cell geometric DSP framework is universal for ALL signal types, not just audio. Audio serves as proof-of-concept, but the framework applies to every form of signal processing imaginable.

The framework handles:
‚Ä¢ Analog signals: Continuous time-domain processing
‚Ä¢ Digital signals: Discrete time-domain processing  
‚Ä¢ Quantum signals: Probabilistic superposition processing
‚Ä¢ Neural signals: Spike-based temporal processing
‚Ä¢ Optical signals: Wave-based frequency processing
‚Ä¢ Biological signals: Adaptive physiological processing
‚Ä¢ Mechanical signals: Vibration and resonance processing
‚Ä¢ Thermal signals: Heat transfer and diffusion processing

The universal framework uses a 5-cell topology where each channel contains time-domain samples, frequency-domain coefficients, geometric position, effects chain, and signal type metadata.

The most profound insight? All signals share the same geometric structure. By understanding this universal geometry, we can process any signal type using the same mathematical framework.

This isn't just about making signal processing more efficient‚Äîit's about discovering the fundamental mathematics that underlies all information processing.

Universal signal processing provides:
‚Ä¢ One framework for all signals - same principles across all domains
‚Ä¢ Mathematical guarantees - relationships are preserved
‚Ä¢ Lossless conversion - no information is lost
‚Ä¢ Reversible transformations - can convert back and forth
‚Ä¢ Scalable architecture - add new signal types by extending the geometry

This universal approach is particularly powerful for AI systems because they can learn the geometric patterns of any signal type, automatically discover new transformation pathways, and handle signal types they've never seen before.
