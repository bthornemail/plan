# Full Autonomous Emacs Operation System Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - Y-Combinator & Recursion Layer

### 1.1 Create `wave-y-combinator.el`

Implement three-level Y-combinator system for fixed-point recursion:

```elisp
;;; Private Y-Combinator (internal self-improvement)
(defun wave-y-combinator-private (f)
  "Private Y-combinator for internal autonomous operations"
  ((lambda (x) (funcall x x))
   (lambda (x) (funcall f (lambda (&rest args) 
                            (apply (funcall x x) args))))))

;;; Public Y-Combinator (user-facing interactions)
(defun wave-y-combinator-public (f user-context)
  "Public Y-combinator with user context preservation"
  ;; Include user approval hooks and supervision
  )

;;; Shared Y-Combinator (collaborative operations)
(defun wave-y-combinator-shared (f collaboration-context)
  "Shared Y-combinator for multi-agent collaboration"
  ;; Include incidence relations and geometric constraints
  )
```

**File Location**: `/home/main/dev/Axiomatic/demos/emacs-demo/wave-y-combinator.el`

### 1.2 Create `wave-workflow-engine.el`

YAML-configurable workflow engine with {read, eval, print, loop} operations:

```elisp
(cl-defstruct wave-workflow
  (workflow-id "" :type string)
  (workflow-type 'repl :type symbol)  ; repl, async-try-catch, spo-modal
  (read-source nil :type (or function string))
  (eval-transform nil :type function)
  (print-output nil :type function)
  (loop-condition nil :type function)
  (async-executor nil :type (or function null))
  (error-handler nil :type (or function null))
  (yaml-definition nil :type (or string null)))

(defun wave-workflow-load-yaml (yaml-file)
  "Load workflow definition from YAML file"
  ;; Parse YAML into wave-workflow structure
  )

(defun wave-workflow-execute (workflow context)
  "Execute workflow with given context using Y-combinator"
  ;; Use appropriate Y-combinator level based on workflow type
  )
```

**YAML Schema**:

```yaml
workflow:
  id: "autonomous-repl-1"
  type: "repl"
  y_combinator_level: "public"  # private, public, shared
  
  read:
    source: "user-input"
    input_type: "s-expression"
    
  eval:
    transform: "autonomous-process-input"
    lambda: "(lambda (input) (autonomous-evolution-engine-process engine input))"
    
  print:
    output: "buffer"
    target: "*Autonomous-REPL*"
    
  loop:
    condition: "user-continue"
    
  async:
    enabled: true
    executor: "timer-based"
    interval: 0.1
    
  error:
    try: "eval-transform"
    catch: "log-and-recover"
    await: "user-intervention"
```

**File Location**: `/home/main/dev/Axiomatic/demos/emacs-demo/wave-workflow-engine.el`

## Phase 2: Async/Await Framework

### 2.1 Create `wave-async-framework.el`

Hybrid async execution with timers and processes:

```elisp
(cl-defstruct wave-async-operation
  (operation-id "" :type string)
  (operation-func nil :type function)
  (async-type 'timer :type symbol)  ; timer, process, hybrid
  (timer-interval 0.1 :type float)
  (callback nil :type (or function null))
  (error-callback nil :type (or function null))
  (state 'pending :type symbol)
  (result nil))

(defun wave-async-execute (operation)
  "Execute operation asynchronously using hybrid approach"
  (pcase (wave-async-operation-async-type operation)
    ('timer (wave-async-execute-timer operation))
    ('process (wave-async-execute-process operation))
    ('hybrid (wave-async-execute-hybrid operation))))

(defun wave-async-await (operation timeout)
  "Await operation result with timeout"
  ;; Poll operation state until complete or timeout
  )

(defun wave-async-try-catch (try-operation catch-operation)
  "Try operation with catch for error handling"
  ;; Wrap in condition-case with async awareness
  )
```

**File Location**: `/home/main/dev/Axiomatic/demos/emacs-demo/wave-async-framework.el`

### 2.2 Update `wave-autonomous.el`

Integrate async capabilities with autonomous evolution:

```elisp
(defun autonomous-async-evolve (engine wave-function)
  "Asynchronously evolve wave function consciousness"
  (let ((async-op (wave-async-operation-create 
                   "evolve-consciousness"
                   (lambda () (autonomous-evolve-consciousness engine wave-function))
                   'timer)))
    (wave-async-execute async-op)))
```

## Phase 3: Multi-Protocol Communication Layer

### 3.1 Create `wave-protocol-adapter.el`

Support for Emacs client, WebSocket, and MQTT:

```elisp
(cl-defstruct wave-protocol-adapter
  (adapter-id "" :type string)
  (protocol-type 'emacsclient :type symbol)  ; emacsclient, websocket, mqtt
  (connection nil)
  (message-queue nil :type list)
  (incidence-relations (make-hash-table :test 'equal) :type hash-table))

(defun wave-protocol-emacsclient-init ()
  "Initialize Emacs client server for external connections"
  (require 'server)
  (unless (server-running-p)
    (server-start)))

(defun wave-protocol-websocket-init (port)
  "Initialize WebSocket server for browser/external connections"
  ;; Use websocket.el or simple HTTP server
  )

(defun wave-protocol-mqtt-init (broker-url topics)
  "Initialize MQTT client for IoT/message-based communication"
  ;; Use mqtt.el or process-based MQTT client
  )

(defun wave-protocol-send (adapter message)
  "Send message through protocol adapter with incidence tracking"
  ;; Track incidence relations for geometric communication
  )
```

**File Location**: `/home/main/dev/Axiomatic/demos/emacs-demo/wave-protocol-adapter.el`

## Phase 4: REPL System with Multi-Level Control

### 4.1 Create `wave-autonomous-repl.el`

Three-level REPL with visual buffer interface:

```elisp
(defun wave-autonomous-repl-start (&optional level)
  "Start autonomous REPL at specified control level"
  (interactive (list (completing-read "Control Level: " 
                                      '("full-supervision" "guided-autonomy" "full-autonomy"))))
  (let* ((repl-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Wave-Autonomous-REPL*"))
         (control-level (intern level))
         (y-combinator-type (pcase control-level
                              ('full-supervision 'public)
                              ('guided-autonomy 'shared)
                              ('full-autonomy 'private)))
         (workflow (wave-workflow-create-repl control-level y-combinator-type)))
    
    ;; Setup visual buffer with real-time updates
    (with-current-buffer repl-buffer
      (wave-autonomous-repl-mode)
      (wave-repl-display-header control-level))
    
    ;; Start async REPL loop using Y-combinator
    (wave-repl-loop-async workflow repl-buffer)))

(defun wave-repl-loop-async (workflow buffer)
  "Asynchronous REPL loop using Y-combinator recursion"
  (let ((repl-func
         (lambda (self)
           (lambda (context)
             ;; Read
             (let ((input (wave-workflow-read workflow context)))
               (when input
                 ;; Eval (async)
                 (wave-async-try-catch
                  (wave-async-operation-create
                   "repl-eval"
                   (lambda () (wave-workflow-eval workflow input context))
                   (wave-workflow-async-executor workflow))
                  ;; Catch
                  (lambda (error)
                    (wave-workflow-error-handle workflow error context)))
                 
                 ;; Print
                 (wave-workflow-print workflow result buffer)
                 
                 ;; Loop (recursive call)
                 (when (wave-workflow-loop-continue workflow context)
                   (funcall self self context))))))))
    
    ;; Start recursion with appropriate Y-combinator
    (funcall (wave-y-combinator-for-level (wave-workflow-y-level workflow) repl-func)
             (wave-workflow-initial-context workflow))))

(define-derived-mode wave-autonomous-repl-mode fundamental-mode "Wave-REPL"
  "Major mode for Wave Function autonomous REPL"
  (setq-local wave-repl-input-marker (make-marker))
  (setq-local wave-repl-output-marker (make-marker)))
```

**Keybindings**:

- `C-c C-i`: Insert autonomous input
- `C-c C-e`: Execute with current control level
- `C-c C-l`: Change control level
- `C-c C-a`: Approve autonomous action (full-supervision mode)
- `C-c C-s`: Show autonomous state
- `C-c C-h`: View workflow history

**File Location**: `/home/main/dev/Axiomatic/demos/emacs-demo/wave-autonomous-repl.el`

## Phase 5: Incidence-Based Workflow Definition

### 5.1 Create `wave-incidence-workflow.el`

Define workflows as incidence relations (graph edges):

```elisp
(cl-defstruct wave-incidence-workflow
  (workflow-id "" :type string)
  (vertices nil :type list)  ; Operations/states
  (edges nil :type list)     ; Transitions/flows
  (incidence-matrix nil)     ; V x E matrix
  (geometric-constraints nil :type list)
  (spo-modality nil :type list))  ; Subject-Predicate-Object-Modality

(defun wave-incidence-workflow-from-yaml (yaml-file)
  "Load incidence-based workflow from YAML"
  ;; Parse YAML with vertices (operations) and edges (flows)
  )

(defun wave-incidence-workflow-execute (workflow context)
  "Execute workflow following incidence relations"
  ;; Traverse graph using geometric constraints
  )
```

**YAML Example**:

```yaml
incidence_workflow:
  id: "autonomous-learning-workflow"
  
  vertices:
    - id: "v0-read-input"
      operation: "read-user-input"
      type: "input"
      
    - id: "v1-analyze"
      operation: "autonomous-analyze-pattern"
      type: "eval"
      
    - id: "v2-learn"
      operation: "autonomous-learn-from-pattern"
      type: "eval"
      
    - id: "v3-display"
      operation: "print-to-buffer"
      type: "output"
      
  edges:
    - id: "e0"
      from: "v0-read-input"
      to: "v1-analyze"
      condition: "input-valid"
      async: true
      
    - id: "e1"
      from: "v1-analyze"
      to: "v2-learn"
      condition: "pattern-detected"
      y_combinator: "private"
      
    - id: "e2"
      from: "v2-learn"
      to: "v3-display"
      condition: "learning-complete"
      
    - id: "e3"
      from: "v3-display"
      to: "v0-read-input"
      condition: "loop-continue"
      
  incidence_matrix:
    rows: ["v0", "v1", "v2", "v3"]
    cols: ["e0", "e1", "e2", "e3"]
    data: [[1,0,0,1], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0]]
    
  spo_modality:
    subject: "autonomous-agent"
    predicate: "learns-from"
    object: "user-input"
    modality: "supervised"  # supervised, autonomous, collaborative
```

  ;; Load workflow definitions
  (wave-workflow-load-directory "~/.emacs.d/wave-function/workflows/")
  
  ;; Start autonomous evolution engine
  (let ((engine (autonomous-evolution-engine-create "main-autonomous-engine" 0.15)))
    (autonomous-evolution-engine-register engine))
  
  ;; Initialize default REPL
  (wave-autonomous-repl-start "guided-autonomy")
  
  (message "Wave Function Autonomous System initialized"))

(defun wave-autonomous-quick-start ()
  "Quick start menu for autonomous operation"
  (interactive)
  (let ((choice (completing-read 
                 "Autonomous Operation Mode: "
                 '("Full Supervision (public Y-combinator)"

                   "Full Autonomy (private Y-combinator)"
                   "Custom Workflow from YAML"))))
    (pcase choice
      ("Full Supervision (public Y-combinator)"
       (wave-autonomous-repl-start "full-supervision"))
      ("Guided Autonomy (shared Y-combinator)"
       (wave-autonomous-repl-start "guided-autonomy"))
      ("Full Autonomy (private Y-combinator)"
       (wave-autonomous-repl-start "full-autonomy"))
      ("Custom Workflow from YAML"
       (call-interactively 'wave-workflow-load-and-execute)))))

    output: "buffer"
    target: "*Autonomous-REPL*"
    format: "pretty-print"
    
  loop:
    condition: "(lambda (ctx) (not (plist-get ctx :quit)))"
