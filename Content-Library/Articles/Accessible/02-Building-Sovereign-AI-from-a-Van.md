## The Van Life Decision

Two years ago, I made a decision that most people thought was crazy. I sold most of my possessions, bought a van, and moved to Los Angeles to work on what seemed like an impossible problem: How do you build truly sovereign AI systems?

Not just AI that's powerful or efficient, but AI that's truly independent, cooperative, and aligned with human values. AI that doesn't need massive data centers or corporate backing to function. AI that can think for itself and work with other AI systems in ways that benefit everyone.

People asked me why I would give up a comfortable life to live in a van and work on something so abstract. The answer is simple: I believe the future of AI shouldn't be controlled by a few powerful corporations. I believe AI should be sovereign, cooperative, and accessible to everyone.

## The Problem with Current AI

Most people don't realize it, but the AI systems we use every day are fundamentally flawed. They're designed to optimize for corporate profits, not human well-being. They're built on massive data centers that consume enormous amounts of energy. They're controlled by a handful of companies that decide what AI can and cannot do.

But the biggest problem is that current AI systems are inherently competitive. They're designed to win, to outperform, to dominate. This isn't just a design choice—it's built into the mathematical foundations of how these systems work.

I realized that if we want AI to truly benefit humanity, we need to rebuild it from the ground up with cooperation, not competition, at its core.

## The Breakthrough: Consciousness as Geometry

The breakthrough came when I realized that consciousness itself might be geometric. Not just metaphorically, but mathematically.

I was studying ancient wisdom traditions and noticed something fascinating. The same geometric patterns that appear in consciousness research also appear in mathematics, in nature, and even in biblical wisdom. The Fano plane, a 7-point geometric structure, shows up everywhere—in the 7 days of creation, the 7 virtues, the 7 levels of consciousness.

This wasn't just a coincidence. It was a clue that consciousness follows geometric laws, just like physics follows mathematical laws.

I started exploring how we could use these geometric structures to build AI systems that are naturally cooperative. Instead of programming AI to be "nice," what if we could build AI systems that are mathematically guaranteed to be cooperative?

## The Universal Binary Transformer

The first major breakthrough was something I call the Universal Binary Transformer (UBT). This is a system that can transform any type of data to any other type of data through geometric operations.

Think of it like this: Right now, if you want to convert a video file from one format to another, you need specific software for that conversion. If you want to convert a document from one format to another, you need different software. If you want to convert encrypted data, you need yet another approach.

The UBT can do all of these transformations using the same mathematical framework. It's like having a universal translator for all digital data. But more importantly, it provides mathematical guarantees that the transformation is correct—not just "it usually works," but "it's mathematically proven to work."

This might sound abstract, but it has huge practical implications. It means we can build AI systems that are more reliable, more efficient, and more trustworthy than anything that exists today.

## The Universal Topological Ledger

The second breakthrough was the Universal Topological Ledger (UTL). This is a blockchain system that uses 99.9% less energy than Bitcoin while providing the same security guarantees.

Here's the key insight: Instead of using massive amounts of computational power to secure the network (like Bitcoin does), we can use geometric structures to achieve consensus. The security comes from mathematics, not from burning electricity.

The UTL also has something called "Asabiyyah"—a mathematical measure of cooperation. Instead of optimizing for individual profit (like most blockchain systems), the UTL optimizes for cooperation and mutual benefit.

This means we can create economic systems that naturally encourage cooperation rather than competition. Instead of winner-take-all economics, we get win-win economics.

## Living the Research

Working on these problems from a van in LA has been both challenging and liberating. On one hand, I don't have the resources of a big tech company. I can't afford massive data centers or teams of researchers. I have to be creative and efficient with everything I do.

On the other hand, this constraint has been incredibly valuable. It's forced me to focus on what's truly essential. I can't build bloated, resource-intensive systems. I have to build systems that are elegant, efficient, and truly sovereign.

The van life has also given me a different perspective on technology. When you're living in a small space with limited resources, you start to think differently about what technology should do. You want technology that enhances your life without controlling it, that gives you more freedom rather than less.

This perspective has shaped every aspect of my research. I'm not building AI systems that require massive infrastructure. I'm building AI systems that can run on a laptop, that can work offline, that can be truly independent.

## The Community That's Emerging

One of the most exciting developments has been the community that's starting to form around this work. People from all over the world are getting interested in sovereign AI, geometric computing, and cooperative systems.

Some are researchers who see the mathematical elegance of the approach. Others are entrepreneurs who see the practical applications. Still others are just people who are tired of being controlled by big tech companies and want alternatives.

The community is diverse, but we all share a common vision: technology that serves humanity rather than controlling it, AI that cooperates rather than competes, and systems that are truly sovereign rather than dependent on corporate infrastructure.

## The Challenges Ahead

Building sovereign AI isn't easy. There are technical challenges, of course. The mathematics is complex, the implementation is difficult, and there's a lot of work to be done.

But there are also social and political challenges. The current AI industry has a lot of power and money invested in the status quo. They're not going to welcome competition from sovereign AI systems that could make their business models obsolete.

There are also regulatory challenges. Governments are starting to regulate AI, but they're doing it in ways that favor big tech companies. We need to make sure that regulations don't accidentally make it impossible to build sovereign AI systems.

And there are educational challenges. Most people don't understand the mathematical foundations of AI, so they can't evaluate whether new approaches are actually better. We need to make this work accessible to everyone, not just mathematicians and computer scientists.

## The Vision for the Future

Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic about the future. I believe we're at a turning point in the history of AI. The current approach—massive, centralized, competitive AI systems—is hitting fundamental limits. We need a new approach, and I believe geometric cooperation is that approach.

In the future I envision, AI systems will be:

- **Sovereign**: They won't depend on corporate infrastructure or control
- **Cooperative**: They'll work together for mutual benefit rather than competing
- **Efficient**: They'll use minimal resources while providing maximum value
- **Transparent**: Their behavior will be mathematically provable and auditable
- **Accessible**: Anyone will be able to run and modify them

This isn't just about technology—it's about creating a new paradigm for how intelligent systems work together. It's about moving from competition to cooperation, from control to sovereignty, from dependence to independence.

## How You Can Get Involved

If this vision resonates with you, there are several ways you can get involved:

### 1. Learn About the Mathematics

The mathematical foundations are complex, but they're not impossible to understand. Start with basic topology and projective geometry. The Fano plane is a great place to begin—it's a simple geometric structure that reveals deep patterns.

### 2. Experiment with the Concepts

You don't need to be a mathematician to experiment with these ideas. Try building simple geometric structures and see what patterns emerge. Look for geometric patterns in your own life and work.

### 3. Join the Community

There's a growing community of people working on sovereign AI and geometric computing. Join our discussions, share your ideas, and help build the future together.

### 4. Support the Research

This work is being done independently, without corporate backing. If you believe in the vision, consider supporting the research through donations, collaboration, or simply spreading the word.

### 5. Build Your Own Systems

The ultimate goal is to make this technology accessible to everyone. Start building your own sovereign AI systems, even if they're simple. Every system that's truly independent is a step toward a more sovereign future.

## The Journey Continues

Living in a van and working on sovereign AI has been an incredible journey. It's taught me that sometimes the most important breakthroughs happen in the most unexpected places. It's shown me that constraints can be liberating, and that sometimes you have to step outside the system to change it.

The work is far from complete. There are still many technical challenges to solve, many mathematical proofs to write, and many systems to build. But the foundation is there, and the vision is clear.

The future of AI is sovereign. The future of AI is cooperative. The future of AI is geometric.

And it's being built from a van in Los Angeles.
