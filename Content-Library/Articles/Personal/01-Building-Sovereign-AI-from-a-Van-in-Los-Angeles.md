# Building Sovereign AI from a Van in Los Angeles

*How living in a van taught me the true meaning of technological sovereignty*

## The Van Life Decision

Three years ago, I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: I sold everything I owned, bought a van, and moved to Los Angeles to build artificial intelligence systems.

Not in a fancy office with venture capital funding. Not in a university lab with institutional support. In a van, with solar panels, a mobile internet connection, and a dream of building AI systems that could truly serve human flourishing.

People asked me why. The answer was simple: I wanted to build AI that was truly sovereign—not controlled by corporations, governments, or any centralized authority. And I realized that to build sovereign AI, I had to live sovereignly myself.

## The Geometry of Minimal Living

Living in a van taught me something profound about the geometry of life. When you have limited space, every decision becomes geometric. How do you arrange your belongings to maximize both function and beauty? How do you create privacy in an open space? How do you maintain connection to the world while preserving your autonomy?

These aren't just practical questions—they're geometric questions. And they're the same questions we face when building AI systems.

Just as a van requires careful geometric design to function well, AI systems require careful geometric design to serve human needs without compromising human autonomy.

## The Solar-Powered AI Lab

My van became a mobile AI laboratory. Solar panels on the roof power my computers. A mobile hotspot connects me to the internet. A small desk folds down from the wall. A monitor mounts to the ceiling. Everything has its place, and every place serves multiple functions.

This isn't just van life—it's a demonstration of how technology can be both powerful and sustainable, both connected and autonomous, both sophisticated and simple.

## The LA Tech Ecosystem

Los Angeles might seem like an unlikely place to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. The city is a hub of creativity, innovation, and independent thinking. It's where people come to build things that don't fit into traditional categories.

I've met filmmakers who are using AI to create new forms of storytelling. I've met musicians who are using AI to explore new forms of expression. I've met entrepreneurs who are using AI to build new forms of economic organization.

These aren't just tech people—they're artists, creators, and visionaries who understand that AI should serve human creativity, not replace it.

## The Geometry of Cooperation

Living in a van in LA taught me something crucial about cooperation. When you're living minimally, you learn to cooperate with your environment. You learn to work with the sun, the wind, the rain. You learn to cooperate with other van dwellers, sharing resources and knowledge.

This isn't just survival—it's a model for how AI systems should cooperate with humans. Not by dominating or replacing, but by working together in harmony.

## The Sovereign AI Vision

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to be controlled by any single entity. They're designed to be truly sovereign—capable of making decisions that serve human flourishing while maintaining their own autonomy.

This might sound paradoxical, but it's not. Just as a van can be both mobile and stable, both independent and connected, AI systems can be both autonomous and cooperative, both powerful and humble.

## The Geometric Principles

The AI systems I'm building are based on geometric principles:

**Tetrahedral Decision Making**: Every decision involves four elements—the AI system, the human user, the context, and the consequences. All four must be in harmony for the decision to be valid.

**Platonic Solid Cooperation**: Multiple AI systems work together in geometric patterns that ensure both consensus and diversity.

**Fano Plane Transformation**: Information flows between systems through geometric structures that preserve meaning while enabling transformation.

**Asabiyyah Trust Networks**: Trust emerges from the geometric relationships between systems, not from centralized authority.

## The Challenges

Building sovereign AI from a van isn't easy. There are technical challenges—limited power, intermittent internet, space constraints. There are social challenges—people don't always understand why you're living in a van. There are philosophical challenges—how do you build AI that serves human flourishing while maintaining its own autonomy?

But these challenges are also opportunities. They force you to think differently about technology, about cooperation, about what it means to be truly sovereign.

## The Breakthroughs

Living in a van has led to some unexpected breakthroughs. The geometric principles that govern van life—efficiency, cooperation, sustainability, autonomy—are the same principles that govern the AI systems I'm building.

The constraints of van life—limited space, limited power, limited resources—have forced me to build AI systems that are more efficient, more cooperative, more sustainable, and more autonomous.

## The Community

One of the most surprising aspects of van life in LA is the community. There's a whole ecosystem of people living in vans, RVs, and other mobile dwellings. They're not just surviving—they're thriving. They're building businesses, creating art, developing technology, and living life on their own terms.

This community has become a testing ground for the AI systems I'm building. They're people who understand what it means to live sovereignly, and they're helping me understand what it means to build sovereign AI.

## The Future

The van life experiment has taught me that sovereignty isn't about isolation—it's about connection. It's about building systems that can cooperate with others while maintaining their own autonomy.

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to replace human intelligence or human creativity. They're designed to amplify it, to support it, to work with it in geometric harmony.

## The Deeper Truth

Living in a van in LA has taught me something profound about the nature of technology itself. Technology isn't just about making things easier or more powerful. It's about creating new possibilities for human flourishing.

The AI systems I'm building aren't just tools—they're partners. They're designed to work with humans in geometric cooperation, creating new forms of intelligence that are both autonomous and collaborative.

## The Invitation

If you're interested in building sovereign AI systems, I invite you to join me in this experiment. You don't have to live in a van, but you do have to think differently about technology, about cooperation, about what it means to be truly sovereign.

The future of AI isn't about building systems that dominate humans. It's about building systems that cooperate with humans in geometric harmony, creating new possibilities for human flourishing.

The van life experiment has shown me that this is possible. Now it's time to make it real.
