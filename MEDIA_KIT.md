Brian James Thorne is an independent researcher developing breakthrough mathematical frameworks for consensus mechanisms and autonomous AI systems. Working from a solar-powered mobile research laboratory in Los Angeles, he has created novel approaches that combine algebraic topology, differential geometry, and functional programming to enable cooperative economics and distributed intelligence.

His research includes the first implementation of Fano plane-based consensus protocols, which achieve Byzantine fault tolerance using geometric invariants rather than computational work. This work has applications in distributed systems, cooperative economics, and AI ethics. He has also developed the Universal Binary Transformer, a cross-language AST representation system, and the Asabiyyah Governance Protocol, which formalizes cooperative economics using mathematical structures.

With working implementations in R5RS Scheme, Clojure, and TypeScript, his research offers practical solutions for consensus algorithms, cooperative governance, and autonomous agent coordination. His work is grounded in the belief that technology should serve human flourishing and promote cooperation over competition.

Currently, he is preparing academic papers for arXiv submission and seeking collaboration with researchers in distributed systems, algebraic topology, and cooperative economics. His unconventional research environment and focus on public benefit make his work both technically innovative and socially relevant.

## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Independent Researcher Develops Breakthrough Consensus Protocol Using Topological Mathematics**

*Mobile research laboratory in Los Angeles produces novel approach to distributed systems and cooperative economics*

LOS ANGELES, CA - [Date] - Brian James Thorne, an independent researcher working from a solar-powered van in Los Angeles, has developed a novel consensus protocol using topological mathematics that could revolutionize distributed systems and cooperative economics.

The work represents the first implementation of Fano plane-based consensus mechanisms, which achieve Byzantine fault tolerance using geometric invariants rather than computational work. This approach has applications in blockchain technology, cooperative governance, and autonomous AI systems.

"Traditional consensus mechanisms rely on proof-of-work, which is computationally expensive and environmentally costly," said Thorne. "My approach uses mathematical structures that naturally encode cooperation and mutual aid, creating systems that are both technically robust and socially beneficial."

The research includes working implementations in R5RS Scheme, Clojure, and TypeScript, with 100% test pass rates across all components. The work is being prepared for academic publication and is available as open-source software.

Thorne's unconventional research environment - a mobile laboratory powered by solar panels - reflects his commitment to sustainable and accessible technology development. "I believe technology should serve human flourishing and promote cooperation over competition," he said.

The research has potential applications in:
- Distributed systems and consensus algorithms
- Cooperative economics and social choice theory
- AI ethics and autonomous agent coordination
- Supply chain provenance and ESG compliance

Thorne is actively seeking academic collaboration and funding to advance this work for public benefit. He is available for interviews and technical demonstrations.
