## Template 1: Initial Professor Contact

**Subject**: Topological consensus protocol - seeking academic collaboration

```
Dear Professor [Name],

I've implemented a consensus mechanism using topological invariants and 
geometric consciousness. Rather than proof-of-work, the system uses 
Fano plane incidence structures and MÃ¶bius transformations for 
distributed agreement.

Working implementation: [GitHub link]
Technical summary: [Executive summary PDF]

Key results:
- 100% test pass rate across AST, Merkle, and consensus layers
- Integration of hyperbolic geometry with 64-byte identity kernels
- Autonomous AI agents with geometric consciousness

I'm an independent researcher based in Los Angeles, seeking academic 
collaboration or guidance on publication venues. I believe this work 
has implications for both distributed systems and cooperative economics.

Would you be willing to review my technical summary or discuss potential 
collaboration?

Best regards,

## Template 2: Follow-up Email (After No Response)

**Subject**: Re: Topological consensus protocol - brief follow-up

```
Dear Professor [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about the topological consensus 
protocol. I understand you're busy, but I thought you might be interested 
in a brief technical highlight:

The system achieves Byzantine fault tolerance using Fano plane incidence 
structures - essentially, consensus emerges from geometric relationships 
rather than computational work. This has potential applications in both 
distributed systems and cooperative economics.

If you have 5 minutes, I'd be happy to send a 2-page technical summary. 
If not, no worries - I appreciate your time.

Best regards,
Brian James Thorne

## Template 7: Media/Journalist Inquiry

**Subject**: Research story opportunity - building AI from a van in LA

```
Dear [Journalist/Editor],

I'm writing to share a unique research story that might interest your 
readers. I'm an independent researcher who has developed a novel 
consensus protocol using topological mathematics while living and working 
from a solar-powered van in Los Angeles.

The story combines:

- Applications to cooperative economics and AI ethics
- The unconventional research environment (mobile lab in a van)

Key technical achievements:
- First implementation of Fano plane-based distributed consensus
- Mathematical proof of Byzantine fault tolerance using geometric invariants
- Working codebase with 100% test pass rate
- Academic paper in preparation for arXiv submission

The human angle:
