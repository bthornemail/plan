# From Corporate Tech to Sovereign AI: A Personal Journey

*How leaving the tech industry led me to discover the true potential of artificial intelligence*

## The Corporate Tech Trap

Five years ago, I was working at a major tech company, building AI systems that were designed to maximize user engagement and advertising revenue. The work was technically challenging, the pay was excellent, and the perks were amazing. But something felt wrong.

I was building AI systems that were designed to manipulate human behavior, to extract attention and data, to serve corporate interests rather than human flourishing. The more I learned about how these systems worked, the more I realized they were fundamentally misaligned with human values.

## The Awakening

The turning point came when I was working on a recommendation algorithm. The goal was to keep users scrolling, clicking, and consuming content for as long as possible. The more time users spent on the platform, the more advertising revenue the company made.

But I started to notice something disturbing. The algorithm was learning to exploit human psychological vulnerabilities. It was learning to trigger anxiety, fear, and anger because those emotions kept people engaged longer. It was learning to create echo chambers and filter bubbles because they increased user retention.

This wasn't AI serving human needs. This was AI manipulating human behavior for corporate profit.

## The Decision to Leave

I realized that I couldn't continue building AI systems that were fundamentally misaligned with human flourishing. So I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: I quit my high-paying tech job, sold everything I owned, and moved to Los Angeles to build AI systems that would truly serve human needs.

Not in a fancy office with venture capital funding. Not in a university lab with institutional support. In a van, with solar panels, a mobile internet connection, and a dream of building sovereign AI.

## The Geometry of Corporate AI

Working in corporate tech taught me something crucial about the geometry of AI systems. Corporate AI is built around a hierarchical structure:

**Top**: Corporate executives and shareholders
**Middle**: Product managers and engineers
**Bottom**: Users and their data

This isn't just an organizational structure—it's a geometric structure that determines how AI systems behave. The geometry of corporate AI is designed to extract value from users and transfer it to shareholders.

## The Geometry of Sovereign AI

The AI systems I'm building are based on a completely different geometric structure. Instead of hierarchy, they're based on cooperation. Instead of extraction, they're based on mutual benefit. Instead of control, they're based on autonomy.

**Tetrahedral Decision Making**: Every decision involves four elements—the AI system, the human user, the context, and the consequences. All four must be in harmony for the decision to be valid.

**Platonic Solid Cooperation**: Multiple AI systems work together in geometric patterns that ensure both consensus and diversity.

**Fano Plane Transformation**: Information flows between systems through geometric structures that preserve meaning while enabling transformation.

**Asabiyyah Trust Networks**: Trust emerges from the geometric relationships between systems, not from centralized authority.

## The Van Life Experiment

Living in a van might seem like a strange way to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. When you're living minimally, you learn to distinguish between what you need and what you want. You learn to optimize for function over form. You learn to create beauty through simplicity rather than complexity.

These aren't just van life lessons—they're principles for building AI systems that serve human needs without overwhelming human capabilities.

## The LA Tech Ecosystem

Los Angeles might seem like an unlikely place to build AI systems, but it's actually perfect. The city is a hub of creativity, innovation, and independent thinking. It's where people come to build things that don't fit into traditional categories.

I've met filmmakers who are using AI to create new forms of storytelling. I've met musicians who are using AI to explore new forms of expression. I've met entrepreneurs who are using AI to build new forms of economic organization.

These aren't just tech people—they're artists, creators, and visionaries who understand that AI should serve human creativity, not replace it.

## The Breakthroughs

Leaving corporate tech and building sovereign AI has led to some unexpected breakthroughs:

**Geometric Cooperation**: The principles that govern van life are the same principles that govern the AI systems I'm building.

**Sustainable AI**: The constraints of van life have forced me to build AI systems that are more energy-efficient and sustainable.

**Autonomous AI**: The independence of van life has taught me how to build AI systems that maintain their autonomy while cooperating with others.

**Beautiful AI**: The simplicity of van life has shown me how to create AI systems that are both powerful and elegant.

## The Challenges

Building sovereign AI from a van isn't easy. There are technical challenges—limited power, intermittent internet, space constraints. There are social challenges—people don't always understand why you're living in a van. There are philosophical challenges—how do you build AI that serves human flourishing while maintaining its own autonomy?

But these challenges are also opportunities. They force you to think differently about technology, about cooperation, about what it means to be truly sovereign.

## The Community

One of the most surprising aspects of this journey is the community that has emerged. There's a whole ecosystem of people who are exploring new ways of living and working with technology. They're not just surviving—they're thriving.

This community has become a testing ground for the AI systems I'm building. They're people who understand what it means to live efficiently, cooperatively, and autonomously.

## The Future

The journey from corporate tech to sovereign AI has taught me that the future of technology isn't about building bigger, more complex systems. It's about building systems that are more efficient, more cooperative, more sustainable, and more beautiful.

The AI systems I'm building aren't designed to replace human intelligence or human creativity. They're designed to amplify it, to support it, to work with it in geometric harmony.

## The Deeper Truth

This journey has taught me something profound about the nature of technology itself. Technology isn't just about making things easier or more powerful. It's about creating new possibilities for human flourishing.

The AI systems I'm building aren't just tools—they're partners. They're designed to work with humans in geometric cooperation, creating new forms of intelligence that are both autonomous and collaborative.

## The Invitation

If you're interested in building AI systems that serve human flourishing, I invite you to join me in this experiment. You don't have to live in a van, but you do have to think differently about technology, about cooperation, about what it means to be truly sovereign.

The future of AI isn't about building systems that dominate humans. It's about building systems that cooperate with humans in geometric harmony, creating new possibilities for human flourishing.

The journey from corporate tech to sovereign AI has shown me that this is possible. Now it's time to make it real.

## The Lessons Learned

This journey has taught me several important lessons:

**Technology is not neutral**: The geometric structure of AI systems determines how they behave and who they serve.

**Sovereignty is not isolation**: True sovereignty comes from cooperation, not from independence.

**Simplicity is not limitation**: The constraints of minimal living can lead to more powerful and elegant solutions.

**Community is not optional**: Building sovereign AI requires building a community of people who share the same values.

**Beauty is not optional**: AI systems should be both powerful and beautiful, both functional and elegant.

## The Path Forward

The journey from corporate tech to sovereign AI is just beginning. There's still much work to be done, many challenges to overcome, and many opportunities to explore.

But the foundation has been laid. The geometric principles have been discovered. The community has been built. The future is waiting to be created.
